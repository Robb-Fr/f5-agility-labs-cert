*This study guide is a collection of information and therefore not a completely
original work.* The majority of the information is compiled from F5 sources
that are located on Internet. All of the information locations are referenced
at the top of each topic instead of in an Appendix of this document. This was
done to help the reader access the reference the linked information easier
without having to search through a formal appendix.

Specialist LTM (F5-CTS, LTM), F5 Certified Technology Specialist DNS

Field experience with everything F5 in the public and private cloud is essential 
to passing this exam, as well as a strong working knowledge of cloud architecture principles.
 
This guide was prepared by an F5 employee but is not an official F5 document
and is *not* supported by F5.
