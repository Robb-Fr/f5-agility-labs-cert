<p>The setup and configuration of an F5 device requires a solid
understanding of network infrastructure and how networks are designed
and built. It doesn’t matter if you are deploying an F5 appliance in a
private data center, an F5 Viprion chassis in a private cloud or an F5
virtual edition in the public cloud, you need to have a mastery of
networking. Even in today’s agile IT landscape where infrastructure is
code and the ability to deploy F5 infrastructure on bare metal using F5
Declarative Onboarding (DO) or other tools like Hashicorp’s Terraform is
common place, you can’t write the code to automate the build on the
network if you don’t understand how networks work.</p>

<p><strong>1.01 – Given a set of requirements, configure VLANs</strong></p>

<p><strong>Configuring VLANs in BIG-IP</strong></p>
<p>There are many different deployment scenarios that will each demand
their own unique configuration and this content in the TMOS
Implementations link will go over a few of them. This exam will possibly
provide a deployment scenario and ask how to create or modify a VLAN to
meet the scenario requirements. An exam candidate should understand that
if the setup wizard is used in the BIG-IP GUI it is going to create two
VLANs named External and Internal. This two VLAN configuration is a
simple type of deployment that can be used in labs and is a great way to
depiction the network flow in a full proxy architecture operating system
like BIG-IP TMOS, but it is not always what is needed in the real world.
An exam candidate should be aware of how to create VLANs in the GUI
without using the wizard and also using TMSH Command Line. There are
examples in the F5 Clouddocs link and more on the F5 Support website.
For me, VLANs should be created on the BIG-IP with a descriptive name
and tag numbers that match the descriptive name and tag number in the
connected Layer-2 switch. VLAN Tagging will not necessarily be enabled
but the tag number will be configured in the switch and can also be
configured in the BIG-IP even with tagging disabled.</p>

<p><strong>1.01 – Assign a numeric tag to the VLAN if required</strong></p>

<p><strong>Assigning a tag number to the vlan</strong></p>
<p><strong>About tagged interfaces</strong></p>
<p>You can create a VLAN and assign interfaces to the VLAN as single- or
double-tagged interfaces. When you assign interfaces as tagged
interfaces, you can associate multiple VLANs with those interfaces.</p>
<p>A VLAN tag is a unique ID number that you assign to a VLAN, to identify
the VLAN to which each packet belongs. If you do not explicitly assign a
tag to a VLAN, the BIG-IP system assigns a tag automatically. The value
of a VLAN tag can be between 1 and 4094. Once you or the BIG-IP system
assigns a tag to a VLAN, any message sent from a host in that VLAN
includes this VLAN tag as a header in the message.</p>
<p>Important: If a device connected to a BIG-IP system interface is another
switch, the VLAN tag that you assign to the VLAN on the BIG-IP system
interface must match the VLAN tag assigned to the VLAN on the interface
of the other switch.</p>

<p><strong>1.01 - Determine appropriate layer 3 addressing for VLAN</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://techdocs.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-routing-administration-13-1-0/5.html#guid-23a8cd0a-ec10-49e7-82c9-dfd78b13b0d6">https://techdocs.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-routing-administration-13-1-0/5.html#guid-23a8cd0a-ec10-49e7-82c9-dfd78b13b0d6</a></p>
<p><strong>Layer 3 addressing for VLAN</strong></p>
<p>Normally in the OSI model, the term VLAN is a Layer 2 configuration
object and IP Addressing is a Layer 3 configuration object. What is
meant by this Objective Example is when a BIG-IP has a Layer 2 VLAN
configured, it must also have an IP address on the Layer 3 IP subnet
associated to that VLAN to participate in the network communications. If
there are two BIG-IP units in an HA pair each using must have a unique
IP in the IP subnet on that VLAN as well as a shared IP that will float
to the active unit in the pair.</p>
<p>The only time the BIG-IP would not have an IP associated to the VLAN is
if the associated VLAN interface ports are to be used to bridge a Layer
2 VLAN through the F5 device. This is a rare configuration case and
essentially makes the BIG-IP a simple Layer 2 switch for those ports
associated to the VLAN.</p>
<p><strong>VLAN association with a self IP address</strong></p>
<p>Every VLAN must have a static self IP address associated with it. The
self IP address of a VLAN represents an address space, that is, the
range of IP addresses pertaining to the hosts in that VLAN. When you ran
the Setup utility earlier, you assigned one static self IP address to
the VLAN external, and one static self IP address to the VLAN internal.
When sending a request to a destination server, the BIG-IP system can
use these self IP addresses to determine the specific VLAN that contains
the destination server.</p>
<p>The self IP address with which you associate a VLAN should represent an
address space that includes the IP addresses of the hosts that the VLAN
contains. For example, if the address of one host is 11.0.0.1 and the
address of the other host is 11.0.0.2, you could associate the VLAN with
a self IP address of 11.0.0.100, with a netmask of 255.255.255.0.</p>

<p><strong>1.01 - Specify if VLAN is tagged or untagged</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://techdocs.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-routing-administration-13-1-0/5.html#guid-23a8cd0a-ec10-49e7-82c9-dfd78b13b0d6">https://techdocs.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-routing-administration-13-1-0/5.html#guid-23a8cd0a-ec10-49e7-82c9-dfd78b13b0d6</a></p>
<p><strong>Setting VLANs as Tagged or Untagged</strong></p>
<p>There can be confusion on this topic, especially if you have a Cisco
background. What F5 calls “VLAN tagging”, Cisco calls “Trunking”. The
difference in configuration naming standards is not what causes the
confusion because regardless of the descriptive name they both mean the
same thing. The system is following the 802.1q standard and adding a
4-byte VLAN tag value to the Ethernet frame that will allow the upstream
switch as well as the BIG-IP to determine the correct VLAN to place an
incoming frame onto when received, thus providing the capability to pass
more than one VLAN’s traffic on the interface. The confusion comes in
when we start to discuss Link Aggregation. Cisco calls link aggregation
a “Port Channel” and F5 calls it “Trunking”.</p>
<p><strong>About untagged interfaces</strong></p>
<p>You can create a VLAN and assign interfaces to the VLAN as untagged
interfaces. When you assign interfaces as untagged interfaces, you
cannot associate other VLANs with those interfaces. This limits the
interface to accepting traffic only from that VLAN, instead of from
multiple VLANs. If you want to give an interface the ability to accept
and receive traffic for multiple VLANs, you add the same interface to
each VLAN as a tagged interface.</p>
<p><strong>About tagged interfaces</strong></p>
<p>You can create a VLAN and assign interfaces to the VLAN as single- or
double-tagged interfaces. When you assign interfaces as tagged
interfaces, you can associate multiple VLANs with those interfaces.</p>
<p>A VLAN tag is a unique ID number that you assign to a VLAN, to identify
the VLAN to which each packet belongs. If you do not explicitly assign a
tag to a VLAN, the BIG-IP system assigns a tag automatically. The value
of a VLAN tag can be between 1 and 4094. Once you or the BIG-IP system
assigns a tag to a VLAN, any message sent from a host in that VLAN
includes this VLAN tag as a header in the message.</p>
<p>Important: If a device connected to a BIG-IP system interface is another
switch, the VLAN tag that you assign to the VLAN on the BIG-IP system
interface must match the VLAN tag assigned to the VLAN on the interface
of the other switch.</p>
<p><strong>About single tagging</strong></p>
<p>This figure shows the difference between using three untagged interfaces
(where each interface must belong to a separate VLAN) versus one
single-tagged interface (which belongs to multiple VLANs).</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Solutions using untagged (left) and single-tagged interfaces (right)</p>
<p>The configuration on the left shows a BIG-IP system with three internal
interfaces, each a separate, untagged interface. This is a typical
solution for supporting three separate customer sites. In this scenario,
each interface can accept traffic only from its own VLAN.</p>
<p>Conversely, the configuration on the right shows a BIG-IP system with
one internal interface and an external switch. The switch places the
internal interface on three separate VLANs. The interface is configured
on each VLAN as a single-tagged interface. In this way, the single
interface becomes a tagged member of all three VLANs, and accepts
traffic from all three. The configuration on the right is the functional
equivalent of the configuration of the left.</p>
<p>Important: If you are connecting another switch into a BIG-IP system
interface, the VLAN tag that you assign to the VLAN on the BIG-IP system
must match the VLAN tag on the interface of the other switch.</p>
<p><strong>About double tagging (This functionality is rarely used in Enterprise
architectural design)</strong></p>
<p>For BIG-IP systems with ePVA hardware support, the system includes
support for the IEEE 802.1QinQ standard. Known informally as Q-in-Q or
double tagging, this standard provides a way for you to insert multiple
VLAN tags into a single frame. This allows you to encapsulate
single-tagged traffic from disparate customers with only one tag.</p>
<p>Double tagging expands the number of possible VLAN IDs in a network.
With double tagging, the theoretical limitation in the number of VLAN
IDs expands from 4096 to 4096x4096.</p>
<p>When you implement double tagging, you specify an inner tag that
encapsulates all of the single-tagged traffic. You then designate all
other tags as outer tags, or customer tags (C-tags), which serve to
identify and segregate the traffic from those customers.</p>
<p>A common use case is one in which an internet service provider creates a
single VLAN within which multiple customers can retain their own VLANs
without regard for overlapping VLAN IDs. Moreover, you can use
double-tagged VLANs within route domains or vCMP guests. In the latter
case, vCMP host administrators can create double-tagged VLANs and assign
the VLANs to guests, just as they do with single-tagged VLANs. For a
vCMP guest running an older version of the BIG-IP software,
double-tagged VLANs are not available for assignment to the guest.</p>
<p>Note: On systems that support double tagging, if you configure a Fast L4
local traffic profile, you cannot enable Packet Velocity Asic (PVA)
hardware acceleration.</p>

<p><strong>1.02 - Explain the function and purpose of a router, of a firewall and of a switch</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router_(computing</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Routers</strong></p>
<p>A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between
computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on
the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or
email, is in the form of data packets. A packet is typically forwarded
from one router to another router through the networks that constitute
an internetwork (e.g. the Internet) until it reaches its destination
node.</p>
<p>A router is connected to two or more data lines from different IP
networks. When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router
reads the network address information in the packet header to determine
the ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table
or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its
journey.</p>

<p><strong>Firewalls</strong></p>
<p>In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and
controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined
security rules. A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a
trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the
Internet.</p>

<p><strong>Switches</strong></p>
<p>A switch is a device in a computer network that connects other devices
together. Multiple data cables are plugged into a switch to enable
communication between different networked devices. Switches manage the
flow of data across a network by transmitting a received network packet
only to the one or more devices for which the packet is intended. Each
networked device connected to a switch can be identified by its network
address, allowing the switch to direct the flow of traffic maximizing
the security and efficiency of the network.</p>
<p>A switch is more intelligent than an Ethernet hub, which simply
retransmits packets out of every port of the hub except the port on
which the packet was received, unable to distinguish different
recipients, and achieving an overall lower network efficiency.</p>
<p>An Ethernet switch operates at the data link layer (layer 2) of the OSI
model to create a separate collision domain for each switch port. Each
device connected to a switch port can transfer data to any of the other
ports at any time and the transmissions will not interfere.[a] Because
broadcasts are still being forwarded to all connected devices by the
switch, the newly formed network segment continues to be a broadcast
domain. Switches may also operate at higher layers of the OSI model,
including the network layer and above. A device that also operates at
these higher layers is known as a multilayer switch.</p>
<p>Segmentation involves the use of a switch to split a larger collision
domain into smaller ones in order to reduce collision probability, and
to improve overall network throughput. In the extreme case (i.e.
micro-segmentation), each device is located on a dedicated switch port.
In contrast to an Ethernet hub, there is a separate collision domain on
each of the switch ports. This allows computers to have dedicated
bandwidth on point-to-point connections to the network and also to run
in full-duplex mode. Full-duplex mode has only one transmitter and one
receiver per collision domain, making collisions impossible.</p>
<p>The network switch plays an integral role in most modern Ethernet local
area networks (LANs). Mid-to-large sized LANs contain a number of linked
managed switches. Small office/home office (SOHO) applications typically
use a single switch, or an all-purpose device such as a residential
gateway to access small office/home broadband services such as DSL or
cable Internet. In most of these cases, the end-user device contains a
router and components that interface to the particular physical
broadband technology. User devices may also include a telephone
interface for Voice over IP (VoIP).</p>

<p><strong>Assigning IP Addresses</strong></p>
<p>There are many different deployment scenarios that will each demand
their own unique configuration and this content in the Techdocs will
explain the types of IP addresses needed by the BIG-IP system. This exam
will possibly provide a deployment scenario and ask how to assign IP
addresses to the BIG-IP system. BIG-IP systems can have multiple IP
addresses because the system can and usually does have a presence on
multiple networks. The out-of-band management interface requires an IP
address. The BIG-IP will have an IP address on each VLAN it is
configured to participate on as well as a floating IP, if it is a part
of an HA pair. This was discussed in section 1.01 of this document. A
functional IP address may have to be determined from a diagram that may
reflect an IP subnet for each network. The candidate should be able to
determine available IP addresses from a given subnet.</p>

<p>An IP address on a Class A network that has not been subnetted would
have an address/mask pair similar to: 8.20.15.1 255.0.0.0. To see how
the mask helps you identify the network and node parts of the address,
convert the address and mask to binary numbers.</p>
<p>8.20.15.1 = 00001000.00010100.00001111.00000001</p>

<p>Once you have the address and the mask represented in binary, then
identifying the network and host ID is easier. Any address bits that
have corresponding mask bits set to 1 represent the network ID. Any
address bits that have corresponding mask bits set to 0 represent the
node ID.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding Subnetting</strong></p>
<p>Subnetting allows you to create multiple logical networks that exist
within a single Class A, B, or C network. If you do not subnet, you are
only able to use one network from your Class A, B, or C network, which
is unrealistic.</p>
<p>Each data link on a network must have a unique network ID, with every
node on that link being a member of the same network. If you break a
major network (Class A, B, or C) into smaller subnets, it allows you to
create a network of interconnecting subnets. Each data link on this
network would then have a unique network/sub-network ID. Any device, or
gateway, connecting n networks/subnets has n distinct IP addresses, one
for each network / sub-network that it interconnects. In order to subnet
a network, extend the natural mask using some of the bits from the host
ID portion of the address to create a sub-network ID. For example, given
a Class C network of 204.17.5.0, which has a natural mask of
255.255.255.0, you can create subnets in this manner:</p>

<p>By extending the mask to be 255.255.255.224, you have taken three bits
(indicated by “sub”) from the original host portion of the address and
used them to make subnets. With these three bits, it is possible to
create eight subnets. With the remaining five host ID bits, each subnet
can have up to 32 host addresses, 30 of which can actually be assigned
to a device since host ids of all zeros or all ones are not allowed (it
is very important to remember this). So, with this in mind, these
subnets have been created.</p>

<p><strong>1.03 - Understand public/private, multicast addressing, and broadcast</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918</a></p>
<p><strong>Public and Private IP addresses</strong></p>
<p>This link to RFC1918 describes address allocation for private internets.
In summary, IPv4 has a relatively small number of available IP
addresses, when you think about every IP addressable node in the world.
To initially try to relieve the pressure on the available IP address
space the RFC1918 set the standard for Private IP addresses. This
basically provided the ability for a few ranges of IP addresses to be
reserved for private networks. Which meant that since they were not
routed publicly on the Internet, the reserved private IP address ranges
could be used within each private internet or what is referred to as an
intranet without affecting the rest of the Internet. The IP address
subnets that are routed on the Internet are considered public IP space
and these reserved IP ranges are considered private.</p>
<p><strong>RFC1918 - Private Address Space</strong></p>
<p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has reserved the
following three blocks of the IP address space for private internets:</p>
<p>10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 (10/8 prefix)</p>
<p>172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255 (172.16/12 prefix)</p>
<p>192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255 (192.168/16 prefix)</p>
<p>We will refer to the first block as “24-bit block”, the second as
“20-bit block”, and to the third as “16-bit” block. Note that (in
pre-CIDR notation) the first block is nothing but a single class A
network number, while the second block is a set of 16 contiguous class B
network numbers, and third block is a set of 256 contiguous class C
network numbers.</p>
<p>An enterprise that decides to use IP addresses out of the address space
defined in this document can do so without any coordination with IANA or
an Internet registry. The address space can thus be used by many
enterprises. Addresses within this private address space will only be
unique within the enterprise, or the set of enterprises which choose to
cooperate over this space so they may communicate with each other in
their own private internet.</p>
<p>As before, any enterprise that needs globally unique address space is
required to obtain such addresses from an Internet registry. An
enterprise that requests IP addresses for its external connectivity will
never be assigned addresses from the blocks defined above.</p>
<p>In order to use private address space, an enterprise needs to determine
which hosts do not need to have network layer connectivity outside the
enterprise in the foreseeable future and thus could be classified as
private. Such hosts will use the private address space defined above.
Private hosts can communicate with all other hosts inside the
enterprise, both public and private. However, they cannot have IP
connectivity to any host outside of the enterprise. While not having
external (outside of the enterprise) IP connectivity private hosts can
still have access to external services via mediating gateways (e.g.,
application layer gateways).</p>
<p>All other hosts will be public and will use globally unique address
space assigned by an Internet Registry. Public hosts can communicate
with other hosts inside the enterprise both public and private and can
have IP connectivity to public hosts outside the enterprise. Public
hosts do not have connectivity to private hosts of other enterprises.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicast_address</a></p>
<p><strong>Multicast Addressing</strong></p>
<p>A multicast address is a logical identifier for a group of hosts in a
computer network that are available to process datagrams or frames
intended to be multicast for a designated network service. The CIDR
notation for this group is 224.0.0.0/4. The group includes the addresses
from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255. Address assignments from within this
range are specified in RFC 5771.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5771">https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5771</a></p>
<p>The address range is divided into blocks each assigned a specific
purpose or behavior.</p>

<p><strong>Broadcast IP</strong></p>
<p>RFC 919 defines the need for a broadcast IP address on each LAN. This is
essentially a reserved IP address in every subnet that when used as a
destination IP address would allow the sending system to speak to
everyone in the subnet at the same time. Much like an all f’s MAC
address at layer 2. The IP reserved and is always the highest IP of the

<p><strong>Purpose of NAT</strong></p>
<p>A Network Address Translation (NAT) is a mapping of one IP address to
another IP address. This mapping can be a translation of source,
destination, or both. A NAT can be outbound or inbound.</p>
<p><strong>Outbound NAT</strong></p>
<p>Outbound NAT translates an internal source address to a public address.
A NAT can also be used to translate an internal node’s IP address to an
Internet routable IP address.</p>

<p><strong>Purpose of DHCP</strong></p>
<p>The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) provides configuration
parameters to Internet hosts. DHCP consists of two components: a
protocol for delivering host-specific configuration parameters from a
DHCP server to a host and a mechanism for allocation of network
addresses to hosts.</p>
<p>DHCP is built on a client-server model, where designated DHCP server
hosts allocate network addresses and deliver configuration parameters to
dynamically configured hosts. Throughout the remainder of this document,
the term “server” refers to a host providing initialization parameters
through DHCP, and the term “client” refers to a host requesting
initialization parameters from a DHCP server.</p>
<p>A host should not act as a DHCP server unless explicitly configured to
do so by a system administrator. The diversity of hardware and protocol
implementations in the Internet would preclude reliable operation if
random hosts were allowed to respond to DHCP requests. For example, IP
requires the setting of many parameters within the protocol
implementation software. Because IP can be used on many dissimilar kinds
of network hardware, values for those parameters cannot be guessed or
assumed to have correct defaults. Also, distributed address allocation
schemes depend on a polling/defense mechanism for discovery of addresses
that are already in use. IP hosts may not always be able to defend their
network addresses, so that such a distributed address allocation scheme
cannot be guaranteed to avoid allocation of duplicate network addresses.</p>
<p>DHCP supports three mechanisms for IP address allocation. In “automatic
allocation”, DHCP assigns a permanent IP address to a client. In
“dynamic allocation”, DHCP assigns an IP address to a client for a
limited period of time (or until the client explicitly relinquishes the
address). In “manual allocation”, a client’s IP address is assigned by
the network administrator, and DHCP is used simply to convey the
assigned address to the client. A particular network will use one or
more of these mechanisms, depending on the policies of the network
administrator.</p>
<p>Dynamic allocation is the only one of the three mechanisms that allows
automatic reuse of an address that is no longer needed by the client to
which it was assigned. Thus, dynamic allocation is particularly useful
for assigning an address to a client that will be connected to the
network only temporarily or for sharing a limited pool of IP addresses
among a group of clients that do not need permanent IP addresses.
Dynamic allocation may also be a good choice for assigning an IP address
to a new client being permanently connected to a network where IP
addresses are sufficiently scarce that it is important to reclaim them
when old clients are retired. Manual allocation allows DHCP to be used
to eliminate the error-prone process of manually configuring hosts with
IP addresses in environments where (for whatever reasons) it is
desirable to manage IP address assignment outside of the DHCP
mechanisms.</p>
<p>The format of DHCP messages is based on the format of BOOTP messages, to
capture the BOOTP relay agent behavior described as part of the BOOTP
specification [7, 21] and to allow interoperability of existing BOOTP
clients with DHCP servers. Using BOOTP relay agents eliminates the
necessity of having a DHCP server on each physical network segment.</p>

<p>When you want to manage Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)
client IP addresses, you can configure the BIG-IP system to act as a
DHCP relay agent. A common reason to configure the BIG-IP system as a
DHCP relay agent is when the DHCP clients reside on a different subnet
than the subnet of the DHCP servers.</p>
<p><strong>About the BIG-IP system as a DHCP relay agent</strong></p>
<p>A BIG-IP virtual server, configured as a Dynamic Host Configuration
Protocol (DHCP) type, provides you with the ability to relay DHCP client
requests for an IP address to one or more DHCP servers, available as
pool members in a DHCP pool, on different +virtual local area networks
(VLANs). The DHCP client request is relayed to all pool members, and the
replies from all pool members are relayed back to the client.</p>
<p>A sample DHCP relay agent configuration</p>

</div>
<p>For example, a DHCP client sends a broadcast message to the destination
IP address 255.255.255.255, which is the destination address configured
on the virtual server. A DHCP type virtual server automatically uses
port 67 for an IPv4 broadcast message or port 547 for an IPv6 broadcast
message. The BIG-IP virtual server receives this message on the VLAN
with self IP address 10.20.0.1 and relays the DHCP request to all DHCP
servers: 10.10.0.3 and 10.10.0.7.</p>
<p>All DHCP servers provide a DHCP response with available IP addresses to
the BIG-IP virtual server, which then relays all responses to the
client. The client accepts and uses only one of the IP addresses
received.</p>
<p>Note: In this example, there is no hop between the DHCP client and the
BIG-IP relay agent. However, a common topology is one that includes this
hop, which is often another BIG-IP system.</p>

<p><strong>IPv6</strong></p>
<p>This Cisco Press link is better reading than the RFC2373 for a clear
understanding of IPv6 address representation. I doubt that you will be
required to know how to do IPv6 subnetting or any in depth IP
calculations during this exam but being able to recognize valid
representations of IPv6 addresses will be essential. You should
familiarize yourself with IPv6. Remember that the BIG-IP operating
system is native IPv6.</p>
<p>IPv6 addresses are 128 bits in length and written as a string of
hexadecimal digits. Every 4 bits can be represented by a single
hexadecimal digit, for a total of 32 hexadecimal values. The
alphanumeric characters used in hexadecimal are not case sensitive;
therefore, uppercase and lowercase characters are equivalent. Although
IPv6 address can be written in lowercase or uppercase, RFC 5952, A
Recommendation for IPv6 Address Text Representation, recommends that
IPv6 addresses be represented in lowercase. As described in RFC 4291,
the preferred form is x:x:x:x:x:x:x:x. Each x is a 16-bit section that
can be represented using up to four hexadecimal digits, with the
sections separated by colons.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address</a></p>
<p><strong>MAC Address</strong></p>
<p>A media access control address (MAC address) is a unique identifier
assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) for use as a network
address in communications within a network segment. This use is common
in most IEEE 802 networking technologies, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and
Bluetooth. Within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network model,
MAC addresses are used in the medium access control protocol sublayer of
the data link layer. As typically represented, MAC addresses are
recognizable as six groups of two hexadecimal digits, separated by
hyphens, colons, or without a separator. In hexadecimal the broadcast
address would be FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF.</p>

<p>MAC addresses are primarily assigned by device manufacturers and are
therefore often referred to as the burned-in address, or as an Ethernet
hardware address, hardware address, and physical address. Each address
can be stored in hardware, such as the card’s read-only memory, or by a
firmware mechanism. Many network interfaces however support changing
their MAC address. The address typically includes a manufacturer’s
organizationally unique identifier (OUI). MAC addresses are formed
according to the principles of two numbering spaces based on Extended
Unique Identifiers (EUI) managed by the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE)</p>

<p><strong>ARP</strong></p>
<p>ARP defines the exchanges between network interfaces connected to an
Ethernet media segment in order to map an IP address to a link layer
address on demand. Link layer addresses are hardware addresses (although
they are not immutable) on Ethernet cards and IP addresses are logical
addresses assigned to machines attached to the Ethernet. Link layer
addresses may be known by many different names: Ethernet addresses,
Media Access Control (MAC) addresses, and even hardware addresses.</p>
<p>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) exists solely to glue together the IP
and Ethernet networking layers. Since networking hardware such as
switches, hubs, and bridges operate on Ethernet frames, they are unaware
of the higher layer data carried by these frames. Similarly, IP layer
devices, operating on IP packets need to be able to transmit their IP
data on Ethernets. ARP defines the conversation by which IP capable
hosts can exchange mappings of their Ethernet and IP addressing.</p>
<p>ARP is used to locate the Ethernet address associated with a desired IP
address. When a machine has a packet bound for another IP on a locally
connected Ethernet network, it will send a broadcast Ethernet frame
containing an ARP request onto the Ethernet. All machines with the same
Ethernet broadcast address will receive this packet. If a machine
receives the ARP request and it hosts the IP requested, it will respond
with the link layer address on which it will receive packets for that IP
address.</p>
<p>Once the requestor receives the response packet, it associates the MAC
address and the IP address. This information is stored in the ARP cache.</p>

adding to the network configuration of the system additional routes may
be needed for proper communications. This exam will possibly provide a

<p><strong>1.05 - Explain why a route is needed</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://techdocs.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-routing-administration-13-1-0/10.html">https://techdocs.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/tmos-routing-administration-13-1-0/10.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Routing and Why Routes Are Needed</strong></p>
<p>Routing is the process of selecting a path for traffic between networks
or across multiple networks. If a network device needs to communicate
with another device off of its local area network (LAN), it must know a
way to get there. For a node with a single network interface on a LAN,
it will normally just be to the router acting as a default gateway for
the IP subnet. But some network devices have multiple network interfaces
on different networks to use or have the responsibility of routing
traffic in the network and the next hop to get to a particular
destination may be out a particular interface. The list of which way to
go to get to the different destination IP addresses is known as a route
table. Static routes can be added to a systems route table which will
allow it to know which way to go to get to all of the IP subnets in a
network, but the management of such a large table would be daunting and
very inefficient. And if a device failed in the path to a destination,
the system would lose communications with the destination until the path
recovered or was manually edited by an administrator to use a different
path that may be available. This is where dynamic routing attempts to
solve the administrative inefficiency problem by constructing routing
tables automatically, based on information learned by routing protocols.
This allows devices on the network to act nearly autonomously in
avoiding network failures and blockages.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system may need to have static routes defined to make traffic
flow out a particular network interface rather than to the default
gateway to reach the intended destination. An example would be needing
to monitor an application or node that is not on the locally attached
subnets of the system and the default gateway has no path to the
destination but a separate router on another local subnet can reach the
destination.</p>
<p>By enabling and configuring any of the BIG-IP advanced routing modules,
you can configure dynamic routing on the BIG-IP system. You enable one
or more advanced routing modules, as well as the Bidirectional
Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol, on a per-route-domain basis.
Advanced routing module configuration on the BIG-IP system provides
these functions:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Dynamically adds routes to the Traffic Management Microkernel (TMM)
and host route tables.</li>
<li>Advertises and redistributes routes for BIG-IP virtual addresses to
other routers.</li>
<li>When BFD is enabled, detects failing links more quickly than would
normally be possible using the dynamic routing protocols’ own
detection mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The BIG-IP advanced routing modules support these protocols.</p>

<p><strong>1.05 - Explain network hops</strong></p>
<p><strong>Network Hops</strong></p>
<p>Network hops refers to the number of networking devices between the
sending unit and the final destination of the communication. Some or all
of these devices can make changes to the datagram in the flow and some
dynamic routing protocols use hop count as a metric in determining the
best path.</p>

<p><strong>Route Tables</strong></p>
<p>Every computer that runs TCP/IP makes routing decisions. The IP routing
table controls these decisions. To display the IP routing table on
computers running Windows Server 2003 operating systems, you can type
“route print” at a command prompt.</p>
<p>The following table shows an example of an IP routing table. This
example is for a computer running Windows Server 2003, Standard Edition
with one 100 megabit per second (Mb/s) network adapter and the following
configuration:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>IP address: 10.0.0.169</li>
<li>Subnet mask: 255.0.0.0</li>
<li>Default gateway: 10.0.0.1</li>
</ul>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<img alt="../../_images/p9.png" src="../../_images/p9.png" />
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>The routing table is built automatically, based on the current TCP/IP
configuration of your computer. Each route occupies a single line in the
displayed table. Your computer searches the routing table for an entry
that most closely matches the destination IP address.</p>
<p>Your computer uses the default route if no other host or network route
matches the destination address included in an IP datagram. The default
route typically forwards an IP datagram (for which there is no matching
or explicit local route) to a default gateway address for a router on
the local subnet. In the previous example, the default route forwards
the datagram to a router with a gateway address of 10.0.0.1.</p>
<p>Because the router that corresponds to the default gateway contains
information about the network IDs of the other IP subnets within the
larger TCP/IP Internet, it forwards the datagram to other routers until
the datagram is eventually delivered to an IP router that is connected
to the specified destination host or subnet within the larger network.</p>
<p>The following sections describe each of the columns displayed in the IP
routing table: network destination, netmask, gateway, interface, and
metric.</p>
<p><strong>Network destination</strong></p>
<p>The network destination is used with the netmask to match the
destination IP address. The network destination can range from 0.0.0.0
for the default route through 255.255.255.255 for the limited broadcast,
which is a special broadcast address to all hosts on the same network
segment.</p>
<p><strong>Gateway</strong></p>
<p>The gateway address is the IP address that the local host uses to
forward IP datagrams to other IP networks. This is either the IP address
of a local network adapter or the IP address of an IP router (such as a
default gateway router) on the local network segment.</p>
<p><strong>Interface</strong></p>
<p>The interface is the IP address that is configured on the local computer
for the local network adapter that is used when an IP datagram is
forwarded on the network.</p>
<p><strong>Metric</strong></p>
<p>A metric indicates the cost of using a route, which is typically the
number of hops to the IP destination. Anything on the local subnet is
one hop, and each router crossed after that is an additional hop. If
there are multiple routes to the same destination with different
metrics, the route with the lowest metric is selected.</p>

the flow and process of the application as it passes through the BIG-IP.
From <em>Virtual Servers</em> that act as the listener which takes in the
inbound connection and depicts how the traffic will be processed through

<p><strong>Distribution of Load</strong></p>
<p>The amount of connections and utilization that an application may have
coming in from its core base of users can often far exceed the
throughput capacity of a single server hosting the application. The need
for distributing the inbound requests and processing load of responses
across a group of servers running the same application or service is
self-evident. The trick to distributing the load is finding the right
load balancing solution and then implementing it in the most effective
manner. While making sure the functions of the applications are not
being broken as users are sent all across the servers in the group.</p>
<p>Load balancing is an integral part of the BIG-IP system. Configuring
load balancing on a BIG-IP system means determining your load balancing
scenario, that is, which pool member should receive a connection hosted
by a particular virtual server. Once you have decided on a load
balancing scenario, you can specify the appropriate load balancing
method for that scenario.</p>
<p>A load balancing method is an algorithm or formula that the BIG-IP
system uses to determine the server to which traffic will be sent.
Individual load balancing methods take into account one or more dynamic
factors, such as current connection count. Because each application of
the BIG-IP system is unique, and server performance depends on a number
of different factors, we recommend that you experiment with different
load balancing methods, and select the one that offers the best
performance in your particular environment.</p>
<p><strong>Default load balancing method</strong></p>
<p>The default load balancing method for the BIG-IP system is Round Robin,
which simply passes each new connection request to the next server in
line. All other load balancing methods take server capacity and or
status into consideration.</p>
<p>If the equipment that you are load balancing is roughly equal in
processing speed and memory, Round Robin method works well in most
configurations. If you want to use the Round Robin method, you can skip
the remainder of this section, and begin configuring other pool settings
that you want to add to the basic pool configuration.</p>
<p><strong>BIG-IP system load balancing methods</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system provides several load balancing methods for load
balancing traffic to pool members.</p>

connections with a much larger connection limit of 500. In this case, the Least Connections method selects server A, the server with the lowest number of active connections,

<tr class="row-odd"><td>Weighted Least Connections (member)
Weighted Least Connections (node)</td>
<td><p class="first">Similar to the Least Connections methods, these load balancing methods select pool members or nodes based on the

capacity. The Weighted Least Connections (member) method specifies that the system uses the value you specify in
Connection Limit to establish a proportional algorithm for each pool member. The system bases the load balancing
decision on that proportion and the number of current connections to that poolmember. For example, member_a has
20 connections and its connection limit is 100, so it is at 20% of capacity. Similarly, member_b has 20 connections
and its connection limit is 200, so it is at 10% of capacity. In this case,the system select selects member_b. This
algorithm requires all pool members to have a non-zero connection limit specified.
The Weighted Least Connections (node) method specifies that the system uses the value you specify in the node’s
Connection Limit setting and the number of current connections to a node to establish a proportional algorithm.
This algorithm requires all nodes used by pool members to have a non-zero connection limit specified.
If all servers have equal capacity, these load balancing methods behave in the same way as the Least Connections

<p><strong>Application Delivery Controllers</strong></p>
<p>A common misconception is that an Application Delivery Controller (ADC)
is an advanced load-balancer. This is not an adequate description. An
ADC is a network device that helps applications to direct user traffic
in order to remove the excess load from two or more servers. In fact, an
ADC includes many OSI layer 3-7 services which happen to include
load-balancing. Other features commonly found in most ADCs include SSL
offload, Web Application Firewall, NAT64, DNS64, and proxy/reverse proxy
to name a few. They also tend to offer more advanced features such as
content redirection as well as server health monitoring.</p>

<p><strong>1.06 - Explain benefits of an application delivery controller</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://devcentral.f5.com/s/articles/6-reasons-you-need-an-application-delivery-controller-now">https://devcentral.f5.com/s/articles/6-reasons-you-need-an-application-delivery-controller-now</a></p>
<p><strong>Some of the Benefits of an ADC</strong></p>
<p>An application delivery controller can solve many problems that arise in
your application environment</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency</strong></p>
<p>An application delivery controller (ADC) can improve the efficiency of
the servers for which it manages application requests. By offloading
compute intensive processing like SSL or TCP/IP connection management an
ADC reduces the overhead associated with assembling and serving
responses to application requests and makes better use of the resources
(RAM, CPU, I/O) on each server. Making your infrastructure more
efficient is also a great way to “go green”.</p>
<p><strong>Performance</strong></p>
<p>The performance of your applications can be improved dramatically
through the deployment of an ADC. Whether it’s because of compression,
caching, protocol optimizations, connection management or intelligent
load balancing algorithms, an ADC improves the overall performance of
your applications.</p>
<p><strong>Reliability</strong></p>
<p>If you rely on applications for business processes or as a revenue
stream, the last thing you want is for those application to be
unavailable. An ADC provides reliability by ensuring that requests are
sent only to available servers, redirecting requests when a server is
down for maintenance or finally hit the wall and died.</p>
<p>If you’re large enough to have two data centers, an ADC with global load
balancing capabilities furthers assurance of reliability by redirecting
requests from the primary data center to a secondary in the event of a
disaster - whether that’s a natural disaster (earthquake, fire, flood)
or man-made (oops - was that our DS3 I just ripped out?).</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>We’re not talking about advanced security options like web application
firewalls or secure remote access products such as an SSL VPN, we’re
just talking basic security here. DDoS protection, rate limiting,
blacklisting, whitelisting, authentication, resource obfuscation, SSL,
content encryption - the bare minimum security you need to protect your
applications and the servers on which they’re deployed. An ADC provides
the core security functions you need to ensure your site is safe.</p>
<p><strong>Capacity</strong></p>
<p>Capacity is about how much throughput, how many requests, how many users
you can support. It’s nearly impossible to support thousands of
concurrent users with a single server, unless it’s one really really
really big server. You need more than one server, and in order to
architect a solution that uses a pool of servers you need something to
mediate and direct those requests - to balance the load across those
servers. That means you need an ADC, because the core purpose of an ADC
is to perform load balancing and ensure that you can serve everyone who
wants to be served.</p>
<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>
<p>Scaling up to meet demand is difficult, doing so without re-architecting
your infrastructure or scheduling down-time is even more difficult. By
including an ADC in your architecture from the very beginning, the
process becomes a simple one. Add a new server, add it to the ADC and
voila! You’ve just scaled up and can instantly support more users and
more requests without requiring downtime or moving around network
cables.</p>
