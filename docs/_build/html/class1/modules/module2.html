<p><strong>2.01 - Identify general meanings of HTTP error codes</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes</a></p>
<p><strong>HTTP error codes</strong></p>
<p>The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) maintains the official
registry of HTTP status codes.</p>
<p>All HTTP response status codes are separated into five classes or
categories. The first digit of the status code defines the class of
response, while the last two digits do not have any classifying or
categorization role. There are five classes defined by the standard:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>1xx informational response – An informational response indicates that
the request was received and understood. It is issued on a
provisional basis while request processing continues. It alerts the
client to wait for a final response. The message consists only of the
status line and optional header fields, and is terminated by an empty
line. As the HTTP/1.0 standard did not define any 1xx status codes,
servers must not send a 1xx response to an HTTP/1.0 compliant client
except under experimental conditions.</li>
<li>2xx successful – This class of status codes indicates the action
requested by the client was received, understood and accepted.</li>
<li>3xx redirection – This class of status code indicates the client must
take additional action to complete the request. Many of these status
codes are used in URL redirection. A user agent may carry out the
additional action with no user interaction only if the method used in
the second request is GET or HEAD. A user agent may automatically
redirect a request. A user agent should detect and intervene to
prevent cyclical redirects.</li>
<li>4xx client error – This class of status code is intended for
situations in which the error seems to have been caused by the
client. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server should
include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation,
and whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status
codes are applicable to any request method. User agents should
display any included entity to the user.</li>
<li>5xx server error – The server failed to fulfill a request. Response
status codes beginning with the digit “5” indicate cases in which the
server is aware that it has encountered an error or is otherwise
incapable of performing the request. Except when responding to a HEAD
request, the server should include an entity containing an
explanation of the error situation and indicate whether it is a
temporary or permanent condition. Likewise, user agents should
display any included entity to the user. These response codes are
applicable to any request method.</li>
</ul>
<p>For this topic, it is good to know the different class levels and to
also understand many of the common errors within each class beyond the
common 302 and 404 and 503. All of which can be found on the link
provided. You never know what might appear on the exam.</p>
<p>There are also codes that are not specified by any standard, but they
are likely not going to appear on this exam.</p>

<p><strong>2.01 - Identify possible reasons and methods for connection termination</strong></p>
<p>(Ref:2)
https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/tcpip-illustrated-volume/0201633469/ch18.html%20-%20ch18lev2sec4</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/http-the-definitive/1565925092/ch04s07.html">https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/http-the-definitive/1565925092/ch04s07.html</a></p>
<p><strong>TCP</strong></p>
<p>While it takes three segments to establish a connection, it takes four
to terminate a connection. This is caused by TCP’s half-close. Since a
TCP connection is full-duplex (that is, data can be flowing in each
direction independently of the other direction), each direction must be
shut down independently. The rule is that either end can send a FIN when
it is done sending data. When a TCP receives a FIN, it must notify the
application that the other end has terminated that direction of data
flow. The sending of a FIN is normally the result of the application
issuing a close.</p>
<p>The receipt of a FIN only means there will be no more data flowing in
that direction. A TCP can still send data after receiving a FIN. While
it’s possible for an application to take advantage of this half-close,
in practice few TCP applications use it.</p>
<p><strong>HTTP Connection Termination</strong></p>
<p>Any HTTP client, server, or proxy can close a TCP transport connection
at any time. The connections normally are closed at the end of a
message, but during error conditions, the connection may be closed in
the middle of a header line or in other strange places.</p>
<p>This situation is common with pipelined persistent connections. HTTP
applications are free to close persistent connections after any period
of time. For example, after a persistent connection has been idle for a
while, a server may decide to shut it down.</p>
<p>However, the server can never know for sure that the client on the other
end of the line wasn’t about to send data at the same time that the
“idle” connection was being shut down by the server. If this happens,
the client sees a connection error in the middle of writing its request
message.</p>
<p>Content-Length and Truncation</p>
<p>Each HTTP response should have an accurate Content-Length header to
describe the size of the response body. Some older HTTP servers omit the
Content-Length header or include an erroneous length, depending on a
server connection close to signify the actual end of data.</p>
<p>When a client or proxy receives an HTTP response terminating in
connection close, and the actual transferred entity length doesn’t match
the Content-Length (or there is no Content-Length), the receiver should
question the correctness of the length.</p>
<p>If the receiver is a caching proxy, the receiver should not cache the
response (to minimize future compounding of a potential error). The
proxy should forward the questionable message intact, without attempting
to “correct” the Content-Length, to maintain semantic transparency.</p>
<p>Connection Close Tolerance, Retries, and Idempotency</p>
<p>Connections can close at any time, even in non-error conditions. HTTP
applications have to be ready to properly handle unexpected closes. If a
transport connection closes while the client is performing a
transaction, the client should reopen the connection and retry one time,
unless the transaction has side effects. The situation is worse for
pipelined connections. The client can enqueue a large number of
requests, but the origin server can close the connection, leaving
numerous requests unprocessed and in need of rescheduling.</p>
<p>Side effects are important. When a connection closes after some request
data was sent but before the response is returned, the client cannot be
100% sure how much of the transaction actually was invoked by the
server. Some transactions, such as GETting a static HTML page, can be
repeated again and again without changing anything. Other transactions,
such as POSTing an order to an online bookstore, shouldn’t be repeated,
or you may risk multiple orders.</p>
<p>A transaction is idempotent if it yields the same result regardless of
whether it is executed once or many times. Implementors can assume the
GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE, TRACE, and OPTIONS methods share this
property.[19] Clients shouldn’t pipeline nonidempotent requests (such as
POSTs). Otherwise, a premature termination of the transport connection
could lead to indeterminate results. If you want to send a nonidempotent
request, you should wait for the response status for the previous
request.</p>
<p>Nonidempotent methods or sequences must not be retried automatically,
although user agents may offer a human operator the choice of retrying
the request. For example, most browsers will offer a dialog box when
reloading a cached POST response, asking if you want to post the
transaction again.</p>
<p>Graceful Connection Close</p>
<p>TCP connections are bidirectional, as shown in the following figure.
Each side of a TCP connection has an input queue and an output queue,
for data being read or written. Data placed in the output of one side
will eventually show up on the input of the other side.</p>
<div class="line-block">

<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Full and half closes</p>
<p>An application can close either or both of the TCP input and output
channels. A close( ) sockets call closes both the input and output
channels of a TCP connection. This is called a “full close” and is
depicted in figure “a” below. You can use the shutdown( ) sockets call
to close either the input or output channel individually. This is called
a “half close” and is depicted in figure “b” and “c” below.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<img alt="../../_images/p11.png" src="../../_images/p11.png" />
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>TCP close and reset errors</p>
<p>Simple HTTP applications can use only full closes. But when applications
start talking to many other types of HTTP clients, servers, and proxies,
and when they start using pipelined persistent connections, it becomes
important for them to use half closes to prevent peers from getting
unexpected write errors.</p>
<p>In general, closing the output channel of your connection is always
safe. The peer on the other side of the connection will be notified that
you closed the connection by getting an end-of-stream notification once
all the data has been read from its buffer.</p>
<p>Closing the input channel of your connection is riskier, unless you know
the other side doesn’t plan to send any more data. If the other side
sends data to your closed input channel, the operating system will issue
a TCP “connection reset by peer” message back to the other side’s
machine, as shown in the figure below. Most operating systems treat this
as a serious error and erase any buffered data the other side has not
read yet. This is very bad for pipelined connections.</p>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<img alt="../../_images/p12.png" src="../../_images/p12.png" />
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>Say you have sent 10 pipelined requests on a persistent connection, and
the responses already have arrived and are sitting in your operating
system’s buffer (but the application hasn’t read them yet). Now say you
send request #11, but the server decides you’ve used this connection
long enough, and closes it. Your request #11 will arrive at a closed
connection and will reflect a reset back to you. This reset will erase
your input buffers.</p>
<p>When you finally get to reading data, you will get a connection reset by
peer error, and the buffered, unread response data will be lost, even
though much of it successfully arrived at your machine.</p>
<p>Graceful close</p>
<p>The HTTP specification counsels that when clients or servers want to
close a connection unexpectedly, they should “issue a graceful close on
the transport connection,” but it doesn’t describe how to do that.</p>
<p>In general, applications implementing graceful closes will first close
their output channels and then wait for the peer on the other side of
the connection to close its output channels. When both sides are done
telling each other they won’t be sending any more data (i.e., closing
output channels), the connection can be closed fully, with no risk of
reset.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the peer implements or checks
for half closes. For this reason, applications wanting to close
gracefully should half close their output channels and periodically
check the status of their input channels (looking for data or for the
end of the stream). If the input channel isn’t closed by the peer within
some timeout period, the application may force connection close to save
resources.</p>
<p><strong>2.01 - Identify possible causes for failure to establish connection</strong></p>
<p><strong>Application Connection failures</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to connection failures to application’s the sky is the
limit for causes. At the simplest level it can be a loss of network
connectivity for the initiating system or receiving system and it goes
up the OSI stack from there with reasons the application is not
responding. You can also have a human error like mistyping a URL,
misconfiguring a setting in a browser or application tool like Putty.
When identifying problems like this you should start with the simplest
causes and work your way up to more complicated issues.</p>

<p><strong>Address Resolution Protocol on the BIG-IP system</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system is a multi-layer network device, and as such, needs to
perform routing functions. To do this, the BIG-IP system must be able to
find destination MAC addresses on the network, based on known IP
addresses. The way that the BIG-IP system does this is by supporting
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP), an industry-standard Layer 3
protocol. ARP will keep a table that contains a one-to-one mapping of
known IP addresses to their corresponding MAC addresses on the systems
local area networks.</p>

<p><strong>Troubleshooting ARP</strong></p>
<p>What are the states of ARP entries?</p>
<p>When you use the BIG-IP Configuration utility to view the entries in the

<p><strong>RESOLVED</strong></p>
<p>Indicates that the system has successfully received an ARP response (a
MAC address) for the requested IP address within two seconds of
initiating the request. An entry in a RESOLVED state remains in the ARP
cache until the timeout period has expired.</p>
<p><strong>INCOMPLETE</strong></p>
<p>Indicates that the system has made one or more ARP requests within the
maximum number of requests allowed, but has not yet received a response.</p>
<p><strong>DOWN</strong></p>
<p>Indicates that the system has made the maximum number of requests
allowed, and still receives no response. In this case, the system
discards the packet, and sends an ICMP host unreachable message to the
sender. An entry with a DOWN state remains in the ARP cache until the
first of these events occurs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Twenty seconds elapse.</li>
<li>The BIG-IP system receives either a resolution response or a
gratuitous ARP from the destination host. (A gratuitous ARP is an ARP
message that a host sends without having been prompted by an ARP
request.)</li>
<li>You explicitly delete the entry from the ARP cache.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>About BIG-IP responses to ARP requests from firewall devices</strong></p>
<p>The system does not respond to ARP requests sent from any firewall that
uses a multicast IP address as its source address.</p>
<p><strong>About gratuitous ARP messages</strong></p>
<p>When dynamically updating the ARP cache, the BIG-IP system includes not
only entries resulting from responses to ARP requests, but also entries
resulting from gratuitous ARP messages.</p>
<p>For security reasons, the system does not fully trust gratuitous ARP
entries. Consequently, if there is no existing entry in the cache for
the IP address/MAC pair, and the BIG-IP system cannot verify the
validity of the gratuitous ARP entry within a short period of time, the
BIG-IP system deletes the entry.</p>

<p><strong>About MAC masquerade addresses</strong></p>
<p>A MAC masquerade address is a unique, floating Media Access Control
(MAC) address that you create and control. You can assign one MAC
masquerade address to each traffic group on a BIG-IP device. By
assigning a MAC masquerade address to a traffic group, you indirectly
associate that address with any floating IP addresses (services)
associated with that traffic group. With a MAC masquerade address per
traffic group, a single VLAN can potentially carry traffic and services
for multiple traffic groups, with each service having its own MAC
masquerade address.</p>
<p>A primary purpose of a MAC masquerade address is to minimize ARP
communications or dropped packets as a result of a failover event. A MAC
masquerade address ensures that any traffic destined for the relevant
traffic group reaches an available device after failover has occurred,
because the MAC masquerade address floats to the available device along
with the traffic group. Without a MAC masquerade address, on failover
the sending host must relearn the MAC address for the newly-active
device, either by sending an ARP request for the IP address for the
traffic or by relying on the gratuitous ARP from the newly-active device
to refresh its stale ARP entry.</p>
<p>The assignment of a MAC masquerade address to a traffic group is
optional. Also, there is no requirement for a MAC masquerade address to
reside in the same MAC address space as that of the BIG-IP device.</p>
<p>Note: When you assign a MAC masquerade address to a traffic group, the
BIG-IP system sends a gratuitous ARP to notify other hosts on the
network of the new address.</p>

<p><strong>2.03 - Explain how to acquire packet captures</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/0000/400/sol411.html">http://support.f5.com/kb/en-us/solutions/public/0000/400/sol411.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Packet Captures</strong></p>
<p>A packet capture can be one of the most powerful tools that an
administrator has at their command. If you are not used to doing packet
captures or have never done one, you should do them in your lab
environment as soon as possible to start becoming proficient. There are
multiple tools that can be used to do a packet capture such as tcpdump,
Wireshark, Windump (Windows based tcpdump), tshark, etc..</p>
<p><strong>Running tcpdump on a busy system</strong></p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> The BIG-IP system is designed as an application delivery
network platform and not as a packet capture device. If you intend to
capture traffic under high load conditions, F5 recommends mirroring
traffic to a dedicated sniffing device.</p>
<p>Running tcpdump on a BIG-IP system is considered best effort, as it will
place more load on the CPU and may result in inaccuracies in the tcpdump
output, such as missed packets or packet timestamp irregularities. If
you run tcpdump on a heavily loaded BIG-IP system, the packet capture
process may not capture all matching traffic, and the statistical values
reported by tcpdump may be inaccurate.</p>
<p>If you run tcpdump on a heavily loaded system, F5 recommends using
tcpdump filter expressions to mitigate the potential for missed packets.</p>
<p>If you are using a packet capture tool other than tcpdump on the Big-IP
platform, you will need to make sure that the system you are running the
capture tool on has access to the local network, which you need to
capture. This may mean that you need to be in line between devices or
you may need a network tap or a span port. If you are capturing the
traffic on your workstation you will need to make sure the network card
can support promiscuous mode and has the right drivers to support the
capture software.</p>
<p><strong>tcpdump</strong></p>
<p>The tcpdump utility is a command line packet sniffer with many features
and options. For a full description, refer to the tcpdump man pages by
typing the following command: man tcpdump</p>
<p>You can read the binary output of a tcpdump using a packet analyzer.
Some analyzer software can also be used to capture traffic as well like
Wireshark.</p>
<p><strong>Running the tcpdump utility</strong></p>
<p>Following are examples of commands used to run the tcpdump utility:</p>
<p><strong>Selecting an Interface or VLAN</strong></p>
<p>The tcpdump utility is able to sniff for packets on only one interface
or VLAN. By default, it selects the lowest numbered interface.</p>
<p>To select an interface, use the -i flag, as follows:</p>
<p>tcpdump -i &lt;interface&gt;</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><strong>To tcpdump a specific interface:</strong></p>
<p>tcpdump -i 2.1</p>
<p>tcpdump -i 1.08</p>
<p><strong>To tcpdump a specific vlan:</strong></p>
<p>tcpdump -i internal</p>
<p>tcpdump -i external</p>
<p><strong>To tcpdump the management interface:</strong></p>
<p>tcpdump -i eth0</p>
<p>Note: Do not attempt to run tcpdump on an interface that contains a
colon.</p>
<p>For example: eth0:mgmt</p>
<p><strong>Disabling name resolution</strong></p>
<p>By default, tcpdump attempts to look up IP addresses and use names,
rather than numbers, in the output. The BIG-IP system must wait for a
response from the DNS server, so the lookups can be time consuming and
the output may be confusing.</p>
<p>To disable name resolution, use the -n flag as in the following
examples:</p>
<p>tcpdump -n</p>
<p>tcpdump -ni internal</p>
<p><strong>Saving tcpdump output to a file</strong></p>
<p>You can save the tcpdump data to one of the following file formats:</p>
<p>A binary file that contains all the information collected by the tcpdump
and is readable by the tcpdump utility as well as many other traffic
analysis packages.</p>
<p>A text file that contains a subset of the full tcpdump data but is
readable only as plain text.</p>
<p>When working with F5 Technical Support, you must provide the tcpdump
output in the binary file format.</p>
<p><strong>Binary file</strong></p>
<p>To save the tcpdump output to a binary file, type the following command:</p>
<p>tcpdump -w &lt;filename&gt;</p>
<p>For example: tcpdump -w dump1.bin</p>
<p>Note: The tcpdump utility does not print data to the screen while it is
capturing to a file. To stop the capture, press CTRL-C.</p>
<p><strong>Text file</strong></p>
<p>To save the tcpdump output to a text file, type the following command:</p>
<p>tcpdump &gt;&lt;filename&gt;</p>
<p>For example: tcpdump &gt;dump1.txt</p>
<p><strong>Reading tcpdump binary file output</strong></p>
<p>To read data from a binary tcpdump file (that you saved by using the
tcpdump -w command), type the following command:</p>
<p>tcpdump -r &lt;filename&gt;</p>
<p>For example: tcpdump -r dump1.bin</p>
<p>In this mode, the tcpdump utility reads stored packets from the file,
but otherwise operates just as it would if it were reading from the
network interface. As a result, you can use formatting commands and
filters.</p>
<p>Beginning in BIG-IP 11.2.0-HF3, 11.2.1-HF3, and 11.3.0, a pseudo header
which includes the following parameters is added to the start of each
binary tcpdump capture:</p>
<p>The tcpdump command syntax used, including all options</p>
<p>Version of software</p>
<p>Hostname of the system</p>
<p>Platform ID</p>
<p>Product</p>
<p><strong>Filters</strong></p>
<p>The tcpdump utility allows you to use filters to, among other things,
restrict the output to specified addresses, ports, and tcp flags.</p>
<p><strong>Filtering on a host address</strong></p>
<p>To view all packets that are traveling to or from a specific IP address,
type the following command:</p>
<p>tcpdump host &lt;IP address&gt;</p>
<p>For example: tcpdump host 10.90.100.1</p>
<p>To view all packets that are traveling from a specific IP address, type
the following command:</p>
<p>tcpdump src host &lt;IP address&gt;</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>tcpdump src host 10.90.100.1</p>
<p>To view all packets that are traveling to a particular IP address, type
the following command:</p>
<p>tcpdump dst host &lt;IP address&gt;</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>tcpdump dst host 10.90.100.1</p>
<p><strong>Filtering on a port</strong></p>
<p>To view all packets that are traveling through the BIG-IP system and are
either sourced from or destined to a specific port, type the following
command:</p>
<p>tcpdump port &lt;port number&gt;</p>
<p>For example: tcpdump port 80</p>
<p>To view all packets that are traveling through the BIG-IP system and
sourced from a specific port, type the following command:</p>
<p>tcpdump src port&lt;port number&gt;</p>
<p>For example: tcpdump src port 80</p>
<p>To view all packets that are traveling through the BIG-IP system and
destined to a specific port, type the following command:</p>
<p>tcpdump dst port &lt;port number&gt;</p>
<p>For example: tcpdump dst port 80</p>
<p><strong>Filtering on a tcp flag</strong></p>
<p>To view all packets that are traveling through the BIG-IP system that
contain the SYN flag, type the following command:</p>
<p>tcpdump ‘tcp[tcpflags] &amp; (tcp-syn) != 0’</p>
<p>To view all packets that are traveling through the BIG-IP system that
contain the RST flag, type the following command:</p>
<p>tcpdump ‘tcp[tcpflags] &amp; (tcp-rst) != 0’</p>

<p><strong>Packet capture data file structure</strong></p>
<p>When looking through a packet capture from a tool like tcpdump, you
should be familiar with the format which the output data is placed into
the capture by the tool.</p>
<p>If you are trying to look for a particular conversation between two
systems, you are looking for the systems IP addreses sending and
receiving packets between each other.</p>
<p>The tcpdump tool will write a file listing out each packet as it is
captured. Each capture packet line item will include a timestamp, sender
IP, sender port, receiver IP, receiver port and flags etc.</p>
<p>SrcIP.port &gt; dstIP.port: Flags [tcpflags], seq data-seqno, ack ackno,
win window, urg urgent, options [opts], length len</p>
<p>You can find the start of a conversation between two systems by looking
for the SYN Flag. First a host, such as your computer, initiates a TCP
connection by providing a TCP SYN packet to the destination host (let’s
just say it’s a file sharing server for this example). After the server
receives the TCP SYN it returns a packet in response with SYN ACK. Now,
once your computer receives the SYN ACK, it will send out one more
packet to establish the connection which contains ACK.</p>

<p><strong>Traffic flow in statistics</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP collects statistics and allows you to review them in the GUI
or CLI. In the GUI the information can be found in Statistics &gt; Module
Statistics &gt; Local Traffic. At a high level these statistics can reflect
that traffic is or is not reaching a certain destination. For example,
if traffic is coming into a virtual server and being sent to a pool for
load balancing, you may want to see if the traffic is being sent across
all of the pool members effectively.</p>

<p><strong>2.04 - Interpret ifconfig output (interface bandwidth)</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifconfig">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ifconfig</a></p>
<p><strong>Ifconfig output</strong></p>
<p>You can read up on Ifconfig in many locations on the internet and I am
including a link to Wikipedia, but essentially ifconfig is a common
Linux command line tool it has been replaced by the IP command in modern
Linux distributions. It can be used to set-up (configure) any/all the
network interfaces as well as look at interface statistics. There is a
great amount of information that can be derived from the output of the
tool like MAC address, MTU size, IP address, transmit and receive
errors, etc..</p>
<p>If you use the ifconfig command without any parameters, it will show you
the interface details from all of the active network interfaces. From
this information, you can determine the amount of data that has
transgressed an interface since it was enabled. This information can
give you an idea of the bandwidth utilization, however understanding the
current interface bandwidth is not as simple as adding the values of the
TX Bytes and the RX Bytes together.</p>
<p>Since the TX and RX data counters continue to grow as the interface
passes traffic, the values being displayed are over a period of time
that started when the interface was last enabled. There is no ability to
clear the counters in ifconfig without an interruption of service. So,
to determine current bandwidth safely you will need to run the date
command for the system time and the ifconfig command to gather the TX
and RX values then do it all for a second time and do some math…</p>
<p>Add the TX and RX vales from the first ifconfig execution and add the TX
and RX values from the second ifconfig execution. Subtract the first
value from the second value. This will give you the amount of data that
transgressed the interface between the 2 ifconfig executions. Remember
that the data is displayed in Bytes, so your results are in MB not Mb.
Then subtract the first date value from the second date value to see
roughly how long it took the calculated data to pass through interface.
Then divide the amount of calculated data by the number of calculated
seconds and you will have a rough per second bandwidth value.</p>
<p>Example of part of the output from an ifconfig command execution on a
BIG-IP:</p>

<p><strong>2.04 - Explain potential L1 failure modes (duplex settings, cable out of specification)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Physical Layer (Layer 1) Failures</strong></p>
<p>Physical layer or Layer 1 failures can be caused by many different
problems from a simple misconfiguration or a hardware/infrastructure
failure. Interface configurations like speed or duplex mismatch can be a
failure due to auto-negotiate not working correctly or a mistake in
manual configuration on interfaces at either end of the connection. This
may result in a loss of packets in higher volume networks, collisions
and or duplex errors. Interfaces may not be enabled in the
configuration of the software causing interfaces to not respond at all.</p>
<p>Hardware and/or infrastructure failures can be caused by many different
issues. Everything from power outages, power cycled devices, hardware
failures, faulty SFP or built-in interface, disconnected cables, broken
cabling, cabling that is out of TIA specifications, EMI and so on.
Hardware failures usually result in a complete loss of connectivity but
can sometimes cause errors to be logged on the actual system or in
neighboring device logs.</p>
