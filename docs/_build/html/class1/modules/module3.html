<p><strong>3.01 – Given a scenario, review basic stats to confirm functionality</strong></p>
<p>You will need to be familiar with the types of statistics and
information that are provided in TMOS. It is more likely that you will
need to be familiar with GUI output, however console-based output will
reflect the same information in a different format. The more familiar
you are with looking at the information provided in either interface,
the faster you can find the answer and move on to the next question.</p>

<p><strong>iHealth Upgrade Advisor</strong></p>
<p>Whether it is upgrading the firmware on a switch, the OS on a server, an
important business application or the software on a BIG-IP, performing
upgrades is something that makes almost all IT Admins and Network
Engineers nervous. We’ve learned from (sometimes painful) experience
that things don’t always go as planned.</p>
<p>Good preparation greatly increases the likelihood that an upgrade will
be successful, which is why F5 has created the iHealth Upgrade Advisor.
Its goal is to provide an additional service from F5 that will
complement your existing upgrade preparations, increasing the
predictability of the upgrade while reducing your upgrade time.</p>
<p>The iHealth Upgrade Advisor service provides a way for users to gain
insight into potential issues with a BIG-IP upgrade before they attempt
the upgrade. It provides guidance that is specific to a BIG-IP based on
its configuration, the version of software it is currently running and
the version you are planning to upgrade to.</p>
<p>When an issue can be avoided by making a configuration change prior to
upgrading, the Upgrade Advisor will tell you exactly what to change. For
some issues, it will list the corrective actions to take after the
upgrade.</p>
<p>There is a video of iHealth Upgrade Advisor on the link of this section.</p>
<p><strong>Accessing the Upgrade Advisor</strong></p>
<p>The next time you are preparing to upgrade a BIG-IP, login to
ihealth.f5.com, upload a .qkview file from that BIG-IP and then view the
qkview after iHealth has analyzed it. The Upgrade Advisor can be
accessed by clicking on its tab in the left-hand menu. Simply select the
version of BIG-IP you are planning to upgrade to in the advisor and
review the results.</p>
<p>Here is a screenshot of the Upgrade Advisor:</p>

<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>As of the time of the release of the blueprint the iHealth Upgrade
Advisor was available. As of January 14, 2020, it is no longer
available.</p>
<p><strong>3.02 - Determine when to upgrade platform</strong></p>

<p><strong>Upgrading platforms</strong></p>
<p>The F5 platform lifecycle support policy defines the stages of the
platform lifecycle from initial release through retirement. This policy
describes the levels of support available for customers with a purchased
Support Agreement. The intent of this policy is to provide consistent
documentation that aids customers in planning and preparing for their
organization’s support needs.</p>
<p><strong>Illustration of a typical platform lifecycle</strong></p>

</div>
<p>The most critical point for a platform is at a platform’s End of
Software Development (EoSD). The End of Software Development date marks
the end of the Regular Support phase and begins the Extended Support
phase. The platform EoSD is the date that F5 Product Development has
ceased considering the repair/maintenance of confirmed software/firmware
defects for the designated platform or software release. Maintenance
Release Software versions and Engineering hotfixes will be supported on
a platform up until the Platform EoSD date. Unless specifically
communicated differently by F5, a platform’s EoSD date defaults to three
years after EoS.</p>
<p>There can be many factors that can cause a need for a platform upgrade,
from the need for additional capacity to age of the system. Common sense
will probably be necessary for this topic.</p>
<p><strong>3.02 - Determine steps to minimize upgrade downtime</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K84554955">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K84554955</a></p>
<p><strong>Preparing for a software upgrade</strong></p>
<p>Before you perform your software upgrade, F5 recommends that you make
the following preparations:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">When you have planned the date for the upgrade, you have the option
to open a proactive service request to reduce the time needed to
speak with a Support Engineer, should you encounter any technical
issues during the upgrade procedure. For more information, refer to
K16022: Opening a proactive service request with F5 Support.</p>
<p>Note: If you want F5 to provide full planning assistance during your
upgrade, you can contact Professional Services. F5 Support will
answer specific questions regarding your upgrade but cannot provide
start-to-finish upgrade assistance. For more information, refer to
Scope of Support.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Confirm your running BIG-IP software version using the TMOS Shell
(tmsh) show /sys software status command. Note the Volume name in
case you decide to boot a previous version at a later time (HD1.1 in
the below example).</p>
<p>For example, the command and output on a system running BIG-IP 12.1.2
appears similar to the following example:</p>
<p>tmsh show /sys software status</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr class="docutils" />
<blockquote>
<div><p>Sys::Software Status</p>
<p>Volume Product Version Build Active Status</p>
</div></blockquote>
<hr class="docutils" />
<blockquote>
<div>HD1.1 BIG-IP 12.1.2 0.0.249 yes complete</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">For BIG-IP 10.x systems, confirm that you are using the volume’s
disk-formatting scheme. For more information, refer to the following
two articles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>K10817: Determining the disk-formatting scheme used by a BIG-IP
version 10.x system</li>
<li>K15459: BIG-IP systems that use partition disk style cannot be
upgraded to versions 11.0.0 or later</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Check the integrity of the running configuration. For BIG-IP 11.x and
later use the tmsh load /sys config verify command. For BIG-IP 10.x
and earlier, use bigpipe verify load. The system should not return
any errors.</p>
<p>Note: Warnings may not hinder a software upgrade but if possible, you
should correct them before you proceed with the upgrade.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Reactivate the system license. For more information, refer to K7727:
License activation may be required prior to a software upgrade for
the BIG-IP or Enterprise Manager system.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Verify that the BIG-IP device certificate has not expired. For more
information, refer to K6353: Updating an SSL device certificate on a
BIG-IP system.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">For high availability (HA) BIG-IP systems, verify that all systems in
the device group are in sync. For more information, refer to K13920:
Performing a ConfigSync using the Configuration utility.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Note your local admin and root user passwords in case you need them
for troubleshooting.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Generate a qkview diagnostics file and upload to BIG-IP iHealth to
look for any triggered upgrade-related heuristics in the Diagnostics
tab. For more information about qkview diagnostics, refer to K12878:
Generating diagnostic data using the qkview utility.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Create a user configuration set (UCS) archive of the BIG-IP
configuration and save it to a secure remote location in case it is
needed for recovery purposes. Retain a UCS archive from every BIG-IP
system in your network on a remote file store to aid disaster
recovery. Even if the archive has aged and does not contain all
configuration objects, it will provide faster recovery time than if
you completely reconfigure the BIG-IP system. For more archive
information, refer to the following articles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>K4423: Overview of UCS archives</li>
<li>K2880: Configuring a replacement BIG-IP device after a Return
Materials Authorization</li>
<li>K13551: Configuring a replacement BIG-IP device after an RMA when
no UCS archive is available</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Beginning in 11.6.3, 12.1.3, and 13.1.0, BIG-IP software no longer
uses cumulative hotfixes. Product defects and security fixes are now
included in a full release referred to as a point release. Point
releases are identified by a fourth version element. If you intend to
install these BIG-IP versions or later versions, you should download
the point release that you plan to install from the F5 Downloads
site. If you intend to install versions that support hotfixes, you
should download the base BIG-IP version that you plan to install from
the F5 Downloads site, including the latest hotfix, if available. For
more information, refer to K167: Downloading software and firmware
from F5.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client</a>–server_model</p>
<p><strong>client-server communication</strong></p>
<p>Client–server model is a distributed application structure that
partitions tasks or workloads between the providers of a resource or
service, called servers, and service requesters, called clients. Often
clients and servers communicate over a computer network on separate
hardware, but both client and server may reside in the same system. A
server host runs one or more server programs, which share their
resources with clients. A client does not share any of its resources,
but it requests content or service from a server. Clients therefore
initiate communication sessions with servers, which await incoming
requests. Examples of computer applications that use the client–server
model are Email, network printing, and the World Wide Web.</p>

<p><strong>Traffic Graphs</strong></p>
<p>The BIG-IP system provides graphical interpretations of system traffic
and other critical information. All of which can be found in the
Statistics section of the Main Menu of the GUI. You should be familiar
with all the graphical output that is provided and how to understand and
read the information. It is very comprehendible even to a novice. All of
the information that is represented can also be sent out via SNMP to
remote monitoring systems, and those systems can also graph the
information.</p>
<p>SNMP is an industry standard protocol for monitoring devices on IP
networks. You can configure the BIG-IP system with SNMP traps and an
SNMP agent that sends data to an SNMP manager. You can then use the
collected data to help you troubleshoot the BIG-IP system.</p>

<p><strong>Active and Inactive Configuration Elements</strong></p>
<p>To determine which configuration objects are active or inactive can take
a bit of observation. The service status of an object is not a direct
indicator of activity. Service status can indicate if the object is
capable of processing traffic. If the object status is Unavailable or is
currently Disabled by an administrator cannot actively process traffic.
An object that has a status of Available can receive/process traffic,
but that status does not mean that it is actively processing traffic,
only that it can. There can always be configuration objects which are
not actively being used for processing traffic, yet are in the
configuration. To see information on objects that are active and
inactive, a quick look at the object status is the easy check to see if
it can take traffic but then you need to see the statistics of available
objects to know if they are active.</p>
<p><strong>Status indicators</strong></p>
<p>The Configuration utility displays various colored icons to report the
status of these objects. When you point to the status icon that
accompanies an object, the BIG-IP system displays information about the
object’s status. The following table lists the icons that the
Configuration utility displays.</p>

<p><strong>Infer services for given netstat</strong></p>
<p>The netstat command can provide plenty of information on the services
running on a system. If the netstat -tulpn | grep LISTEN is used the
returning information will contain which services are listening on what
ports. It will also provide the name of the service on the system.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<div class="line-block">

</div>
<img alt="../../_images/p42.png" src="../../_images/p42.png" />
<hr class="docutils" />
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>However, if the netstat command did not include all of these switches
the output may not be as defined and you may have to know which services
use which port numbers.</p>

</div>
<p>There are 65536 ports per IP address, and each can be used. You should
be familiar with as many of the well-known ports and their associated
services as possible, as well as the proprietary ports that F5 uses like
4353 for iquery. My guess is this topic will ask if a certain service is
running on the system or which IP is running a particular service on the
system and you will have to use the netstat output to determine the
answer. As long as you are familiar with netstat output and the common
ports and their services you should be able to figure this one out.</p>

<p><strong>netstat Output</strong></p>
<p>Netstat command displays various network related information such as
network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade
connections, multicast memberships etc.</p>
<p>The netstat -a command will list all ports, both listening and
non-listening. There are variations on the -a switch that can allow you
to see just TCP ports (-at) or UDP ports (-au).</p>
<p>You can use netstat -l to list just the listening ports. There are
variations on the -l switch that can allow you to see just TCP ports
(-lt), UDP ports (-lu), UNIX ports (-lx).</p>
<p>The output of netstat -lt on a BIG-IP system will give you something
similar to the output below.</p>

<p><strong>QKview</strong></p>
<p>To run the qkview utility from the Configuration utility in BIG-IP
13.0.0 and later, perform the following procedure:</p>
<p>Impact of procedure: The qkview utility runs a large number of commands
when collecting information. This behavior may cause an additional
performance burden on systems that are already under heavy load.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Log in to the Configuration utility.</li>
<li>Go to System &gt; Support.</li>
<li>Select New Support Snapshot.</li>
<li>For Health Utility, select Generate QKView.</li>
<li>Select Start.</li>
<li>To download the output file, select Download.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Starting in BIG-IP 13.1.0, you can override the default 5 MB
maximum log file size of the QKView by selecting the Unlimited snaplen
check box in the QKView Options section prior to selecting Start.
Overriding the default size limit can result in very large QKView files.
You should only use this option when instructed to do so by F5 Support.</p>
<p><strong>Uploading a QKView file to F5 iHealth</strong></p>
<p>After you obtain the QKView diagnostic file, you can upload the file to
F5 iHealth to diagnose the health and proper operation of your BIG-IP or
BIG-IQ system. To do so, perform the following procedure:</p>
<p>Impact of procedure: The qkview utility runs a large number of commands

<p><strong>3.05 - Review logs</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K16197">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K16197</a></p>
<p><strong>Reviewing BIG-IP log files</strong></p>
<p>BIG-IP log files include important diagnostic information about the
events that are occurring on the BIG-IP system. Some of the events
pertain to the Linux host. For example, the Linux host generates system
messages that pertain to the Linux host operating system, including
messages that are logged during system startup, and information logged
by the background daemons that run on the system. Other events are
specific to the BIG-IP operating system. For example, the BIG-IP
operating system generates messages that pertain to local and global
traffic events, and configuration changes (audit logging).</p>
<p>Local logging</p>
<p>By default, the BIG-IP system logs events locally and stores messages in
the /var/log directory. For BIG-IP events, the system routes messages
from the errdefs subsystem through syslog-ng to the local log files. For
non-BIG-IP events, the system routes messages directly through syslog-ng
to the local log files. In addition, you can configure the system to use
the high-speed logging mechanism (HSL) to store the logs in either the
syslog or the MySQL database.</p>
<p>Remote logging</p>
<p>You can configure the system to use the HSL mechanism to log messages to
a pool of remote log servers. If the BIG-IP system processes a high
volume of traffic or generates an excessive amount of log files, F5
recommends that you configure remote logging.</p>
<p>BIG-IP log types</p>
<p>Each type of event is stored locally in a separate log file, and the
information stored in each log file varies depending on the event type.
All log files for these event types are in the /var/log directory.</p>

<p><strong>BIG-IP System Vitals</strong></p>
<p>Using AVR you can display system level statistics over a period of time
in graphical charts on the BIG-IP system. Several charts are available,
and they show the following information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Internet Protocol (IP) packets, errors, and fragments</li>
<li>Virtual server traffic details, TCP traffic, and UDP traffic</li>
<li>CPU usage</li>
<li>CPU utilization per process</li>
<li>Memory statistics for TMM, other processes, system RAM, and swap space</li>
<li>Disk activity, sizes, and latency</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view the historical statistics for different periods of time. On
systems with multiple slots, you can view the statistics for each slot.
You can also export the information in any of the reports to PDF or
comma-separated value (CSV) format, and save the reports or email them.</p>
<p>But if AVR is not provisioned on the system you can look at system level
information in the GUI or CLI. In the GUI the information can be found
in Statistics &gt; Performance Reports. The data is presented in MRTG style
graphs that are easy to understand.</p>
