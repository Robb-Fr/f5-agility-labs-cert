<p><strong>4.01 - Explain the purpose of an IP TTL</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_live</a></p>
<p><strong>IP TTL</strong></p>
<p>Under the Internet Protocol, TTL is an 8-bit field. In the IPv4 header,
TTL is the 9th octet of 20. In the IPv6 header, it is the 8th octet of
40. The maximum TTL value is 255, the maximum value of a single octet. A
recommended initial value is 64.</p>
<p>The time-to-live value can be thought of as an upper bound on the time
that an IP datagram can exist in an Internet system. The TTL field is
set by the sender of the datagram and reduced by every router on the
route to its destination. If the TTL field reaches zero before the
datagram arrives at its destination, then the datagram is discarded and
an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) error datagram (11 - Time
Exceeded) is sent back to the sender. The purpose of the TTL field is to
avoid a situation in which an undeliverable datagram keeps circulating
on an Internet system, and such a system eventually becoming swamped by
such “immortals”.</p>
<p>In theory, under IPv4, time to live is measured in seconds, although
every host that passes the datagram must reduce the TTL by at least one
unit. In practice, the TTL field is reduced by one on every hop. To
reflect this practice, the field is renamed hop limit in IPv6.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility</a>)</p>
<p><strong>ICMP - Ping</strong></p>
<p>Ping is a computer network administration software utility used to test
the reachability of a host on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. It is
available for virtually all operating systems that have networking
capability, including most embedded network administration software.</p>
<p>Ping measures the round-trip time for messages sent from the originating
host to a destination computer that are echoed back to the source. The
name comes from active sonar terminology that sends a pulse of sound and
listens for the echo to detect objects under water.</p>
<p>Ping operates by sending Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo
request packets to the target host and waiting for an ICMP echo reply.
The program reports errors, packet loss, and a statistical summary of
the results, typically including the minimum, maximum, the mean
round-trip times, and standard deviation of the mean.</p>

<p><strong>ICMP Destination unreachable</strong></p>
<p>Destination unreachable is generated by the host or its inbound gateway
to inform the client that the destination is unreachable for some
reason. Reasons for this message may include: the physical connection to
the host does not exist (distance is infinite); the indicated protocol
or port is not active; the data must be fragmented but the ‘don’t
fragment’ flag is on. Unreachable TCP ports notably respond with TCP RST
rather than a destination unreachable type 3 as might be expected.
Destination unreachable is never reported for IP Multicast
transmissions.</p>

<p><strong>OSI Model</strong></p>
<p>The Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model) is a conceptual model
that characterizes and standardizes the communication functions of a
telecommunication or computing system without regard to its underlying
internal structure and technology. Its goal is the interoperability of
diverse communication systems with standard communication protocols. The
model partitions a communication system into abstraction layers. The
original version of the model had seven layers.</p>
<p>A layer serves the layer above it and is served by the layer below it.
For example, a layer that provides error-free communications across a
network provides the path needed by applications above it, while it
calls the next lower layer to send and receive packets that constitute
the contents of that path. Two instances at the same layer are
visualized as connected by a horizontal connection in that layer.</p>
<p>The model is a product of the Open Systems Interconnection project at
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model</a></p>
<p><strong>Layer 2: Data Link Layer</strong></p>
<p>The data link layer provides node-to-node data transfer. A link between
two directly connected nodes. It detects and possibly corrects errors
that may occur in the physical layer. It defines the protocol to
establish and terminate a connection between two physically connected
devices. It also defines the protocol for flow control between them.</p>
<p>IEEE 802 divides the data link layer into two sublayers:</p>
<p>Medium access control (MAC) layer – responsible for controlling how
devices in a network gain access to a medium and permission to transmit
data.</p>
<p>Logical link control (LLC) layer – responsible for identifying and
encapsulating network layer protocols, and controls error checking and
frame synchronization.</p>
<p>The MAC and LLC layers of IEEE 802 networks such as 802.3 Ethernet,
802.11 Wi-Fi, and 802.15.4 ZigBee operate at the data link layer.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model</a></p>
<p><strong>Layer 4: Transport Layer</strong></p>
<p>The transport layer provides the functional and procedural means of
transferring variable-length data sequences from a source to a
destination host, while maintaining the quality of service functions.</p>
<p>The transport layer controls the reliability of a given link through
flow control, segmentation/desegmentation, and error control. Some
protocols are state- and connection-oriented. This means that the
transport layer can keep track of the segments and re-transmit those
that fail delivery. The transport layer also provides the
acknowledgement of the successful data transmission and sends the next
data if no errors occurred. The transport layer creates segments out of
the message received from the application layer. Segmentation is the
process of dividing a long message into smaller messages.</p>
<p>An easy way to visualize the transport layer is to compare it with a
post office, which deals with the dispatch and classification of mail
and parcels sent. A post office inspects only the outer envelope of mail
to determine its delivery. Higher layers may have the equivalent of
double envelopes, such as cryptographic presentation services that can
be read by the addressee only. Roughly speaking, tunneling protocols
operate at the transport layer, such as carrying non-IP protocols such
as IBM’s SNA or Novell’s IPX over an IP network, or end-to-end
encryption with IPsec. While Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) might
seem to be a network-layer protocol, if the encapsulation of the payload
takes place only at the endpoint, GRE becomes closer to a transport
protocol that uses IP headers but contains complete Layer 2 frames or
Layer 3 packets to deliver to the endpoint. L2TP carries PPP frames
inside transport segments.</p>
<p>Although not developed under the OSI Reference Model and not strictly
conforming to the OSI definition of the transport layer, the
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
of the Internet Protocol Suite are commonly categorized as layer-4
protocols within OSI.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model</a></p>
<p><strong>Layer 3: Network Layer</strong></p>
<p>The network layer provides the functional and procedural means of
transferring variable length data sequences (called packets) from one
node to another connected in “different networks”. A network is a medium
to which many nodes can be connected, on which every node has an address
and which permits nodes connected to it to transfer messages to other
nodes connected to it by merely providing the content of a message and
the address of the destination node and letting the network find the way
to deliver the message to the destination node, possibly routing it
through intermediate nodes. If the message is too large to be
transmitted from one node to another on the data link layer between
those nodes, the network may implement message delivery by splitting the
message into several fragments at one node, sending the fragments
independently, and reassembling the fragments at another node. It may,
but does not need to, report delivery errors.</p>
<p>Message delivery at the network layer is not necessarily guaranteed to
be reliable; a network layer protocol may provide reliable message
delivery, but it need not do so.</p>
<p>A number of layer-management protocols, a function defined in the
management annex, ISO 7498/4, belong to the network layer. These include
routing protocols, multicast group management, network-layer information
and error, and network-layer address assignment. It is the function of
the payload that makes these belong to the network layer, not the
protocol that carries them.</p>

<p><strong>4.02 - Identify the layer for applications</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model</a></p>
<p><strong>Layer 7: Application Layer</strong></p>
<p>The application layer is the OSI layer closest to the end user, which
means both the OSI application layer and the user interact directly with
the software application. This layer interacts with software
applications that implement a communicating component. Such application
programs fall outside the scope of the OSI model. Application-layer
functions typically include identifying communication partners,
determining resource availability, and synchronizing communication. When
identifying communication partners, the application layer determines the
identity and availability of communication partners for an application
with data to transmit. The most important distinction in the application
layer is the distinction between the application-entity and the
application. For example, a reservation website might have two
application-entities: one using HTTP to communicate with its users, and
one for a remote database protocol to record reservations. Neither of
these protocols have anything to do with reservations. That logic is in
the application itself. The application layer has no means to determine
the availability of resources in the network.</p>

<p><strong>4.03 - Explain use of TLS/SSL</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security</a></p>
<p><strong>Transport Layer Security</strong></p>
<p>Transport Layer Security (TLS), and its now-deprecated predecessor,
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), are cryptographic protocols designed to
provide communications security over a computer network. Several
versions of the protocols find widespread use in applications such as
web browsing, email, instant messaging, and voice over IP (VoIP).
Websites can use TLS to secure all communications between their servers
and web browsers.</p>
<p>Client-server applications use the TLS protocol to communicate across a
network in a way designed to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.</p>
<p>Since applications can communicate either with or without TLS (or SSL),
it is necessary for the client to indicate to the server the setup of a
TLS connection. One of the main ways of achieving this is to use a
different port number for TLS connections, for example port 443 for
HTTPS. Another mechanism is for the client to make a protocol-specific
request to the server to switch the connection to TLS; for example, by
making a STARTTLS request when using the mail and news protocols.</p>
<p>Once the client and server have agreed to use TLS, they negotiate a
stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure. The protocols use
a handshake with an asymmetric cipher to establish not only cipher
settings but also a session-specific shared key with which further
communication is encrypted using a symmetric cipher. During this
handshake, the client and server agree on various parameters used to
establish the connection’s security</p>

<p><strong>4.03 - Explain the purpose of TLS/SSL certificates (self-signed vs CA signed)</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority</a></p>
<p><strong>Digital Certificates</strong></p>
<p>A digital certificate certifies the ownership of a public key by the
named subject of the certificate and indicates certain expected usages
of that key. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon
signatures or on assertions made by the private key that corresponds to
the certified public key.</p>
<p><strong>Certificate Authorities</strong></p>
<p>TLS typically relies on a set of trusted third-party certificate
authorities to establish the authenticity of certificates. Trust is
usually anchored in a list of certificates distributed with user agent
software and can be modified by the relying party.</p>
<p>Trusted certificates can be used to create secure connections to a
server via the Internet. A certificate is essential in order to
circumvent a malicious party which happens to be on the route to a
target server which acts as if it were the target. Such a scenario is
commonly referred to as a man-in-the-middle attack. The client uses the
CA certificate to authenticate the CA signature on the server
certificate, as part of the authorizations before launching a secure
connection. Usually, client software—for example, browsers—include a set
of trusted CA certificates. This makes sense, as many users need to
trust their client software. A malicious or compromised client can skip
any security check and still fool its users into believing otherwise.
Mozilla, which is a non-profit business, issues several commercial CA
certificates with its products. While Mozilla developed their own
policy, the CA/Browser Forum developed similar guidelines for CA trust.
A single CA certificate may be shared among multiple CAs or their
resellers. A root CA certificate may be the base to issue multiple
intermediate CA certificates with varying validation requirements.</p>
<p>In addition to commercial CAs, some non-profits issue digital
certificates to the public without charge; notable examples are CAcert
and Let’s Encrypt. Large organizations or government bodies may have
their own PKIs (public key infrastructure), each containing their own
CAs.</p>
<p>Any site using self-signed certificates acts as its own CA. These
self-signed certificates will not be known publicly and thus not a part
of the default trusted CA certificates.</p>

<p><strong>4.03 - Explain the rationale for using TLS/SSL</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security</a></p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong></p>
<p>When secured by TLS, connections between a client (e.g., a web browser)
and a server (e.g., wikipedia.org) should have one or more of the
following properties:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The connection is private (or secure) because symmetric cryptography
is used to encrypt the data transmitted. The keys for this symmetric
encryption are generated uniquely for each connection and are based
on a shared secret that was negotiated at the start of the session.
The server and client negotiate the details of which encryption
algorithm and cryptographic keys to use before the first byte of data
is transmitted. The negotiation of a shared secret is both secure
(the negotiated secret is unavailable to eavesdroppers and cannot be
obtained, even by an attacker who places themselves in the middle of
the connection) and reliable (no attacker can modify the
communications during the negotiation without being detected).</li>
<li>The identity of the communicating parties can be authenticated using
public-key cryptography. This authentication can be made optional but
is generally required for at least one of the parties (typically the
server).</li>
<li>The connection is reliable because each message transmitted includes
a message integrity check using a message authentication code to
prevent undetected loss or alteration of the data during
transmission.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the properties above, careful configuration of TLS can
provide additional privacy-related properties such as forward secrecy,
ensuring that any future disclosure of encryption keys cannot be used to
decrypt any TLS communications recorded in the past.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network</a></p>
<p><strong>VPN</strong></p>
<p>A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a
public network and enables users to send and receive data across shared
or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected
to the private network. Applications running on a computing device,
e.g., a laptop, desktop, smartphone, across a VPN may therefore benefit
from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.
Encryption is a common, though not an inherent, part of a VPN
connection.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="http://www.f5.com/">http://www.f5.com/</a></p>
<p><strong>Rationale for VPN</strong></p>
<p>VPN technology was developed to allow remote users and branch offices to
access corporate applications and resources. To ensure security, the
private network connection is established using an encrypted layered
tunneling protocol, and VPN users use authentication methods, including
passwords or certificates, to gain access to the VPN. In other
applications, Internet users may secure their connections with a VPN to
circumvent geo-restrictions and censorship or to connect to proxy
servers to protect personal identity and location to stay anonymous on
the Internet.</p>

<p><strong>Uses for VPN</strong></p>
<p>VPNs can help increase the security of transmitted data. There are
multiple types of VPNs and the most common business uses for VPN are for
individual remote access, site-to-site tunnels. SSL VPNs are used for
Individual remote access because the client software is a common
browser. This makes use and support easy. An IPsec VPN uses the standard
IPsec mechanism to establish a VPN over the public Internet. An IPsec
VPN is most useful for establishing a VPN between fixed end-points, such
as two offices for a site-to-site tunnel.</p>

<p><strong>4.05 - Explain methods of providing HA integrity</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://techdocs.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-system-maintain-high-availability-through-resource-monitoring-13-0-0/1.html#guid-8c89ba3c-54db-4400-b002-0ed28e79af5c">https://techdocs.f5.com/kb/en-us/products/big-ip_ltm/manuals/product/bigip-system-maintain-high-availability-through-resource-monitoring-13-0-0/1.html#guid-8c89ba3c-54db-4400-b002-0ed28e79af5c</a></p>
<p><strong>Levels of HA Integrity</strong></p>
<p>HA integrity can be improved through providing deeper system monitoring
or deeper levels of availability monitoring of the resources. At the
highest levels, if an entire DC is offline you can do checks at a global
level and take action to send traffic to a second DC with a GSLB device.
Within a DC Basic HA can be achieved between two systems by simple
health checks to see if the active system is up and operating. Or you
may have a cluster of systems each backing up others in the cluster in
an N+1 style configuration, such as device service clustering (DSC)
which is covered in the next section. Further checking of resources can
also be provided by BIG-IP through HA Groups enabled in a DSC.</p>
<p><strong>Introduction to failover</strong></p>
<p>When you configure a Sync-Failover device group as part of device
service clustering, you ensure that a user-defined set of
application-specific IP addresses, known as a floating traffic group,
can fail over to another device in that device group if necessary. DSC
failover gives you granular control of the specific configuration
objects that you want to include in failover operations.</p>
<p>If you want to exclude certain devices on the network from participating
in failover operations, you simply exclude them from membership in that
particular Sync-Failover device group.</p>
<p>What triggers failover?</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system initiates failover of a traffic group according to any
of several events that you define. These events fall into these
categories:</p>
<p>System fail-safe</p>
<p>With system fail-safe, the BIG-IP system monitors various hardware
components, as well as the heartbeat of various system services. You can
configure the system to initiate failover whenever it detects a
heartbeat failure.</p>
<p>Gateway fail-safe</p>
<p>With gateway fail-safe, the BIG-IP system monitors traffic between an
active BIG-IP® system in a device group and a pool containing a gateway
router. You can configure the system to initiate failover whenever some
number of gateway routers in a pool of routers becomes unreachable.</p>
<p>VLAN fail-safe</p>
<p>With VLAN fail-safe, the BIG-IP system monitors network traffic going
through a specified VLAN. You can configure the system to initiate
failover whenever the system detects a loss of traffic on the VLAN and
the fail-safe timeout period has elapsed.</p>
<p>HA groups</p>
<p>With an HA group, the BIG-IP system monitors the availability of
resources for a specific traffic group. Examples of resources are trunk
links, pool members, and VIPRION® cluster members. If resource levels
fall below a user-defined level, the system triggers failover.</p>
<p>Auto-failback</p>
<p>When you enable auto-failback, a traffic group that has failed over to
another device fails back to a preferred device when that device is
available. If you do not enable auto-failback for a traffic group, and
the traffic group fails over to another device, the traffic group
remains active on that device until that device becomes unavailable.</p>
<p>About IP addresses for failover</p>
<p>Part of configuring a Sync-Failover device group is configuring
failover. Configuring failover requires you to specify certain types of
IP addresses on each device. Some of these IP addresses enable
continual, high availability (HA) communication among devices in the
device group, while other addresses ensure that application traffic
processing continues when failover occurs.</p>
<p>The IP addresses that you need to specify as part of HA configuration
are:</p>
<p>A local, static self IP address for VLAN HA</p>
<p>This unicast self IP address is the main address that other devices in
the device group use to communicate continually with the local device to
assess the health of that device. When a device in the device group
fails to receive a response from the local device, the BIG-IP system
triggers failover.</p>
<p>A local management IP address</p>
<p>This unicast management IP address serves the same purpose as the static
self IP address for VLAN HA, but is only used when the local device is
unreachable through the HA static self IP address.</p>
<p>One or more floating IP addresses associated with a traffic group</p>
<p>These are the IP addresses that application traffic uses when passing
through a BIG-IP system. Each traffic group on a device includes
application-specific floating IP addresses as its members. Typical
traffic group members are: floating self IP addresses, virtual
addresses, NAT or SNAT translation addresses, and IP addresses
associated with an iApp application service. When a device with active
traffic groups becomes unavailable, the active traffic groups become
active on other device in the device group. This ensures that
application traffic processing continues with little to no interruption.</p>

<p><strong>Providing HA</strong></p>
<p>An active-standby pair is a pair of BIG-IP devices configured so that
one device is actively processing traffic while the other device remains
ready to take over if failover occurs. The two devices synchronize their
configuration data and can fail over to one another in the event that
one of the devices becomes unavailable.</p>
<p>An active-active pair is a pair of BIG-IP devices configured so that
both devices are actively processing traffic and are ready to take over
one another if failover occurs. The two devices synchronize their
configuration data to one another.</p>
<p><strong>Device service clustering</strong></p>
<p>Device service clustering, or DSC, is an underlying architecture within
BIG-IP Traffic Management Operation System (TMOS). DSC provides
synchronization and failover of BIG-IP configuration data at
user-defined levels of granularity, among multiple BIG-IP devices on a
network. More specifically, you can configure a BIG-IP device on a
network to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Synchronize some or all of its configuration data among several
BIG-IP devices</li>
<li>Fail over to one of many available devices</li>
<li>Mirror connections to a peer device to prevent interruption in
service during failover</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have two BIG-IP devices only, you can create either an
active-standby or an active-active configuration. With more than two
devices, you can create a configuration in which multiple devices are
active and can fail over to one of many, if necessary.</p>
<p>By setting up DSC, you ensure that BIG-IP configuration objects are
synchronized and can fail over at useful levels of granularity to the
most-available BIG-IP devices on the network. You also ensure that
failover from one device to another, when enabled, occurs seamlessly,
with minimal to no interruption in application delivery.</p>
<p>The BIG-IP system supports either homogeneous or heterogeneous hardware
platforms within a device group.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability</a></p>
<p><strong>Advantages of HA</strong></p>
<p>High availability (HA) is a characteristic of a system, which aims to
ensure an agreed level of operational performance, usually uptime, for a
higher than normal period. High availability requires less human
intervention to restore operation in complex systems; the reason for
this being that the most common cause for outages is human error.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://computer.howstuffworks.com/dns.htm">https://computer.howstuffworks.com/dns.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>Domain Name System (DNS)</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve ever used the Internet, it’s a good bet that you’ve used the
Domain Name System, or DNS, even without realizing it. DNS is a protocol
within the set of standards for how computers exchange data on the
Internet and on many private networks, known as the TCP/IP protocol
suite. Its basic job is to turn a user-friendly domain name like
“howstuffworks.com” into an Internet Protocol (IP) address like
70.42.251.42 that computers use to identify each other on the network.
It’s like your computer’s GPS for the Internet.</p>
<p>Computers and other network devices on the Internet use an IP address to
route your request to the site you’re trying to reach. This is similar
to dialing a phone number to connect to the person you’re trying to
call. Thanks to DNS, though, you don’t have to keep your own address
book of IP addresses. Instead, you just connect through a domain name
server, also called a DNS server or name server, which manages a massive
database that maps domain names to IP addresses.</p>

<p><strong>DNS Tools</strong></p>
<p>Most operating systems come with a standard set of DNS tools that allow
you to perform certain tasks.</p>
<p>Tools such as “nsLookup”, “dig” and “host” to name a few are useful for
analyzing DNS records. These tools allow you to perform manual DNS
lookups, through your locally defined DNS server or via alternate
servers. You should be familiar with all tools that can be used to check
DNS functionality not just these few, as well as the types of output
from these tools.</p>

<p><strong>4.06 - Explain what syslog is</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog</a></p>
<p><strong>syslog</strong></p>
<p>In computing, syslog is a standard for message logging. It allows
separation of the software that generates messages, the system that
stores them, and the software that reports and analyzes them. Each
message is labeled with a facility code, indicating the software type
generating the message, and assigned a severity level.</p>
<p>Computer system designers may use syslog for system management and
security auditing as well as general informational, analysis, and
debugging messages. A wide variety of devices, such as printers,
routers, and message receivers across many platforms use the syslog
standard. This permits the consolidation of logging data from different
types of systems in a central repository. Implementations of syslog
exist for many operating systems.</p>

<p><strong>4.06 - Explain the purpose of NTP</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol</a></p>
<p><strong>NTP Purpose</strong></p>
<p>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a networking protocol for clock
synchronization between computer systems over packet-switched,
variable-latency data networks. In operation since before 1985, NTP is
one of the oldest Internet protocols in current use.</p>
<p>NTP is intended to synchronize all participating computers to within a
few milliseconds of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). It uses the
intersection algorithm to select accurate time servers and is designed
to mitigate the effects of variable network latency. NTP can usually
maintain time to within tens of milliseconds over the public Internet
and can achieve better than one millisecond accuracy in local area
networks under ideal conditions. Asymmetric routes and network
congestion can cause errors of 100 ms or more.</p>
<p>The protocol is usually described in terms of a client-server model but
can as easily be used in peer-to-peer relationships where both peers
consider the other to be a potential time source.</p>

<p><strong>4.06 - Explain SNMP as it pertains to ADC element monitoring</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K4026">https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K4026</a></p>
<p><strong>BIG-IP platforms support SNMP monitoring</strong></p>
<p>You can use Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) to query and
monitor all BIG-IP platforms for chassis fan speed, chassis temperature,
CPU fan speed, CPU temperature, and power supply status.</p>
<p>The system uses an SNMP script, system_check, to gather the required
information. The system then monitors this information and, when it
detects that certain parameters exceed the system-defined threshold, it
notifies you by either logging a message to the system log file or
issuing an SNMP trap (when you configure the system to send traps).</p>
<p>You can use SNMP polling to obtain this information by importing the F5
management information base (MIB) file, F5-BIGIP-SYSTEM-MIB.txt, into
your SNMP polling device and configuring the BIG-IP SNMP agent to allow
access from the polling device.</p>
