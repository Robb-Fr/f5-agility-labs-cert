**Overview 301B - LTM Specialist: Maintain and Troubleshoot**

Welcome to the 301b - LTM Specialist compiled Study Guide. The purpose of this
guide is to help you prepare for the F5 301b - LTM Specialist exam. The
contents of this document are based on the 301b - LTM Specialist Exam Blueprint
for TMOS v11.5.
 
**This study guide provides students with some of the basic foundational
knowledge required to pass the exam.**

*This study guide is a collection of information and therefore not a completely
original work.* The majority of the information is compiled from F5 sources
that are located on Internet.  All of the information locations are referenced
at the top of each topic instead of in an Appendix of this document. This was
done to help the reader access the reference the linked information easier
without having to search through a formal appendix.   

The F5 301a - Local Traffic Manager Specialist: Architect, Setup and Deploy,
stand as a pre-requisite to this exam. 

Taking certified F5 LTM training, such as Administering BIG-IP v11 and
Configuring BIG-IP LTM v11, will surely help with the topics of this exam but
does not teach directly to the exam content. Hands on administrative experience
with the BIG-IP platform licensed with LTM will reinforce many of the topics
contained in the 301b - LTM Specialist exam.
 
This guide was prepared by an F5 employee but is not an official F5 document
and is not supported by F5 Networks.
